<div class="number">1</div><div class="verse"> [A Psalm by Asaph.] Surely God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">2</div><div class="verse"> But as for me, my feet were almost gone. My steps had nearly slipped.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">3</div><div class="verse"> For I was envious of the arrogant, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">4</div><div class="verse"> For there are no struggles in their death, but their strength is firm.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">5</div><div class="verse"> They are free from burdens of men, neither are they plagued like other men.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">6</div><div class="verse"> Therefore pride is like a chain around their neck. Violence covers them like a garment.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">7</div><div class="verse"> Their eyes bulge with fat. Their minds pass the limits of conceit.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">8</div><div class="verse"> They scoff and speak with malice. In arrogance, they threaten oppression.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">9</div><div class="verse"> They have set their mouth in the heavens. Their tongue walks through the earth.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">10</div><div class="verse"> Therefore their people return to them, and they drink up waters of abundance.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">11</div><div class="verse"> They say, "How does God know? Is there knowledge in the Most High?"</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">12</div><div class="verse"> Behold, these are the wicked. Being always at ease, they increase in riches.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">13</div><div class="verse"> Surely in vain I have cleansed my heart, and washed my hands in innocence,</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">14</div><div class="verse"> For all day long have I been plagued, and punished every morning.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">15</div><div class="verse"> If I had said, "I will speak thus;" behold, I would have betrayed the generation of your children.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">16</div><div class="verse"> When I tried to understand this, it was too painful for me;</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">17</div><div class="verse"> Until I entered God's sanctuary, and considered their latter end.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">18</div><div class="verse"> Surely you set them in slippery places. You throw them down to destruction.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">19</div><div class="verse"> How they are suddenly destroyed! They are completely swept away with terrors.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">20</div><div class="verse"> As a dream when one wakes up, so, Lord, when you awake, you will despise their fantasies.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">21</div><div class="verse"> For my soul was grieved. I was embittered in my heart.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">22</div><div class="verse"> I was so senseless and ignorant. I was a brute beast before you.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">23</div><div class="verse"> Nevertheless, I am continually with you. You have held my right hand.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">24</div><div class="verse"> You will guide me with your counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">25</div><div class="verse"> Who do I have in heaven? There is no one on earth who I desire besides you.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">26</div><div class="verse"> My flesh and my heart fails, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">27</div><div class="verse"> For, behold, those who are far from you shall perish. You have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to you.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">28</div><div class="verse"> But it is good for me to come close to God. I have made the Lord Yahweh my refuge, that I may tell of all your works.</div>
