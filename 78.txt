<div class="number">1</div><div class="verse"> [A contemplation by Asaph.] Hear my teaching, my people. Turn your ears to the words of my mouth.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">2</div><div class="verse"> I will open my mouth in a parable. I will utter dark sayings of old,</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">3</div><div class="verse"> Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">4</div><div class="verse"> We will not hide them from their children, telling to the generation to come the praises of Yahweh, his strength, and his wondrous works that he has done.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">5</div><div class="verse"> For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a teaching in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children;</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">6</div><div class="verse"> that the generation to come might know, even the children who should be born; who should arise and tell their children,</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">7</div><div class="verse"> that they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments,</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">8</div><div class="verse"> and might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that didn't make their hearts loyal, whose spirit was not steadfast with God.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">9</div><div class="verse"> The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">10</div><div class="verse"> They didn't keep God's covenant, and refused to walk in his law.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">11</div><div class="verse"> They forgot his doings, his wondrous works that he had shown them.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">12</div><div class="verse"> He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">13</div><div class="verse"> He split the sea, and caused them to pass through. He made the waters stand as a heap.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">14</div><div class="verse"> In the daytime he also led them with a cloud, and all night with a light of fire.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">15</div><div class="verse"> He split rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">16</div><div class="verse"> He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">17</div><div class="verse"> Yet they still went on to sin against him, to rebel against the Most High in the desert.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">18</div><div class="verse"> They tempted God in their heart by asking food according to their desire.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">19</div><div class="verse"> Yes, they spoke against God. They said, "Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">20</div><div class="verse"> Behold, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out, and streams overflowed. Can he give bread also? Will he provide flesh for his people?"</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">21</div><div class="verse"> Therefore Yahweh heard, and was angry. A fire was kindled against Jacob, anger also went up against Israel,</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">22</div><div class="verse"> because they didn't believe in God, and didn't trust in his salvation.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">23</div><div class="verse"> Yet he commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">24</div><div class="verse"> He rained down manna on them to eat, and gave them food from the sky.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">25</div><div class="verse"> Man ate the bread of angels. He sent them food to the full.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">26</div><div class="verse"> He caused the east wind to blow in the sky. By his power he guided the south wind.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">27</div><div class="verse"> He rained also flesh on them as the dust; winged birds as the sand of the seas.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">28</div><div class="verse"> He let them fall in the midst of their camp, around their habitations.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">29</div><div class="verse"> So they ate, and were well filled. He gave them their own desire.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">30</div><div class="verse"> They didn't turn from their cravings. Their food was yet in their mouths,</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">31</div><div class="verse"> when the anger of God went up against them, killed some of the fattest of them, and struck down the young men of Israel.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">32</div><div class="verse"> For all this they still sinned, and didn't believe in his wondrous works.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">33</div><div class="verse"> Therefore he consumed their days in vanity, and their years in terror.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">34</div><div class="verse"> When he killed them, then they inquired after him. They returned and sought God earnestly.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">35</div><div class="verse"> They remembered that God was their rock, the Most High God, their redeemer.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">36</div><div class="verse"> But they flattered him with their mouth, and lied to him with their tongue.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">37</div><div class="verse"> For their heart was not right with him, neither were they faithful in his covenant.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">38</div><div class="verse"> But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn't destroy them. Yes, many times he turned his anger away, and didn't stir up all his wrath.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">39</div><div class="verse"> He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passes away, and doesn't come again.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">40</div><div class="verse"> How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness, and grieved him in the desert!</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">41</div><div class="verse"> They turned again and tempted God, and provoked the Holy One of Israel.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">42</div><div class="verse"> They didn't remember his hand, nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">43</div><div class="verse"> how he set his signs in Egypt, his wonders in the field of Zoan,</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">44</div><div class="verse"> he turned their rivers into blood, and their streams, so that they could not drink.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">45</div><div class="verse"> He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">46</div><div class="verse"> He gave also their increase to the caterpillar, and their labor to the locust.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">47</div><div class="verse"> He destroyed their vines with hail, their sycamore fig trees with frost.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">48</div><div class="verse"> He gave over their livestock also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">49</div><div class="verse"> He threw on them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, indignation, and trouble, and a band of angels of evil.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">50</div><div class="verse"> He made a path for his anger. He didn't spare their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence,</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">51</div><div class="verse"> and struck all the firstborn in Egypt, the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">52</div><div class="verse"> But he led forth his own people like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">53</div><div class="verse"> He led them safely, so that they weren't afraid, but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">54</div><div class="verse"> He brought them to the border of his sanctuary, to this mountain, which his right hand had taken.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">55</div><div class="verse"> He also drove out the nations before them, allotted them for an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">56</div><div class="verse"> Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God, and didn't keep his testimonies;</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">57</div><div class="verse"> but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers. They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">58</div><div class="verse"> For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">59</div><div class="verse"> When God heard this, he was angry, and greatly abhorred Israel;</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">60</div><div class="verse"> So that he forsook the tent of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">61</div><div class="verse"> and delivered his strength into captivity, his glory into the adversary's hand.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">62</div><div class="verse"> He also gave his people over to the sword, and was angry with his inheritance.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">63</div><div class="verse"> Fire devoured their young men. Their virgins had no wedding song.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">64</div><div class="verse"> Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows couldn't weep.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">65</div><div class="verse"> Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep, like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">66</div><div class="verse"> He struck his adversaries backward. He put them to a perpetual reproach.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">67</div><div class="verse"> Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph, and didn't choose the tribe of Ephraim,</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">68</div><div class="verse"> But chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion which he loved.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">69</div><div class="verse"> He built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which he has established forever.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">70</div><div class="verse"> He also chose David his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds;</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">71</div><div class="verse"> from following the ewes that have their young, he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob, his people, and Israel, his inheritance.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="number">72</div><div class="verse"> So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart, and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.</div>
</div>
